Hey there, my name's Elijah (@efdeaton).
I'm a Computer Science major at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte.
I'm in my junior year and pursuing a concentration in Cyber Security.
So far, I've learned Python, Java, C, C++, Kotlin, a little bit of JavaScript, and a little HTML.
I'm currently working my way through Rust using the online textbook provided by Rust's creators.
You can reach me through my school email, edeaton4@uncc.edu
